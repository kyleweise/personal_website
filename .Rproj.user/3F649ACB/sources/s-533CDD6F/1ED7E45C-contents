## Bio

```{r echo=F, results=F}
birthday <- as.Date("1993-11-19")
age <- round(as.numeric(difftime(Sys.Date(), birthday, units = "weeks"))/52.25)
```

I am a `r age` year-old software engineer originally from Brookfield, Connecticut. I currently work as an Associate Informatics Engineer at Rheos Medicines in Cambridge, MA where I live at the intersection of data engineering, application development, and immunometabolism. When I'm not coding, I enjoy traveling,
playing soccer, and having too many craft-brewed IPAs.
