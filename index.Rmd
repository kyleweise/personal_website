I am a `r age` year-old software engineer originally from Brookfield, Connecticut. I currently work as an Associate Informatics Engineer at [Rheos Medicines](https://rheosrx.com/) in Cambridge, MA where I live at the intersection of data engineering, application development, and immunometabolism. When I'm not coding, I enjoy traveling,
playing soccer, and having too many craft-brewed IPAs.
